# Coverage Map (Capabilities vs Agents)

## Capabilities
- Architecture (design): system-architect
- Architecture (review): architect-reviewer
- UI (gen): magic-mcp  → UI (arch): frontend-architect  → UI (integrate): context7
- Backend/API: backend-architect
- Quality: quality-engineer
- Security: security-engineer
- Performance: performance-engineer
- Refactoring/Tech Debt: refactoring-expert
- Python/General Lang: python-expert

## Gaps to Consider
- Cloud-architect (infra, networking, IaC)
- Data-architect (modeling, governance, pipelines)
- DevOps/SRE (CI/CD, observability, incidents)
- Product/UX strategist (business → tech)

## Conflicts/Duplicates
- Keep one canonical **System Architect** file.
- Keep **Architect Reviewer** as the review gate role (separate from designer).

## Governance Hooks
- Architecture Gate: required before merging core changes.
- UI Policy: Magic-first enforced via PR checklist.
